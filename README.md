# Handwritten Digit Classification using ANN

This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset.

# Project Highlights

- Data loading, preprocessing, and normalization
- ANN-based model design and training
- Loss function: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
- Activation functions: ReLU and Softmax
- Evaluation and interpretation of model predictions
- Focused on understanding multiclass classification concepts

# Project Goal

The primary objective was to learn how multiclass classification works in neural networks, including label encoding, probability computation, and how ANN models produce final predictions.

# Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
